### 📘 Overview  
This project performs an end-to-end **data analysis of power consumption trends** using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** in Python.  
It explores time-series behavior, detects anomalies, visualizes seasonal patterns, and extracts meaningful insights from electricity usage data.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab or open it in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Mount your Google Drive if you’re using Colab.  
3. Load your dataset (`powerconsumption.csv`) into the notebook.  
4. Run all steps one by one from **Step 1 → Step 30**.  
5. Once execution completes, all the final results (datasets, charts, and summaries) will be automatically saved inside the **project_output** folder.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Identified **daily and weekly usage patterns**  
- Found **peak consumption hours** for load management  
- Detected **off-peak hours** suitable for cost optimization  
- Flagged **anomalies** — unusual spikes or drops in power use  
- Highlighted **trends** through rolling mean and volatility charts
